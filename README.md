# Chess Games Project

This Java project is dedicated to implementing various chess puzzles and scenarios. The development environment for this project is Intellij IDEA.

## Project Overview

### Chess Puzzles

1. **Lonely Knight (8x8 board)**
    - Place a knight on the top-left square of a 8x8 chessboard. Move the knight in a legal knight's move to reach the bottom-right square.

2. **Maximalist Knight (6x6 board)**
    - Position a knight on the top-left square of a 6x6 chessboard. Traverse the entire board using legal knight's moves, ensuring each square is visited exactly once.

3. **Eight Bishops (5x4 board)**
    - Set up a chessboard with 4 dark bishops in the top row and 4 light bishops in the bottom row. Swap all the pieces, ensuring they move only according to the rules of a bishop, and no piece can capture another.

4. **Six Knights (4x3 board)**
    - Arrange a chessboard with 3 dark knights in the top row and 3 light knights in the bottom row. Swap all the pieces, making sure they move only according to the rules of a knight, and no piece can capture another.

5. **The BodyGuard Square (8x8 board)**
    - Given a chessboard with a specific arrangement of pieces, the challenge is to move any capturing piece to the square marked on the board following the rules of chess.

6. **The Tight Game (3x2 board)**
    - Starting from a given initial position, perform a series of legal chess moves to reach a specific target position as shown in the provided image.
